# Automatic-Drip-Irrigation-System
Developed an automatic drip irrigation system using an ATmega328 microcontroller and moisture sensor.
Designed the system to deliver water and nutrients to plants in a precise and controlled manner, optimizing plant growth and minimizing water waste based on real-time soil moisture readings.
Conducted extensive research on drip irrigation techniques and their benefits, and applied this knowledge to improve the system's performance.
Collaborated with a team of engineers and designers to design and test the system, ensuring its reliability and efficiency.
Utilized Arduino IDE to program the ATmega328 microcontroller and moisture sensor, and to collect and analyze data on soil moisture levels.
Successfully implemented the system in a collage garden and achieved results, as increased crop yields and reduced water consumption
